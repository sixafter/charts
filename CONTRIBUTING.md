## Versioning

This software adheres to the [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standard for version numbering as quoted here:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## üé® Coding Guidelines

Adhering to consistent coding standards ensures the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.

### üñãÔ∏è Style Guidelines

Adhering to consistent coding styles ensures the project remains readable and maintainable. Below are the style guidelines to follow when contributing:

1. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use proper indentation and spacing as per the language's standard practices.
   - Run the linter (e.g., `make lint`) to ensure your code adheres to the project's style rules.
   - For YAML files:
     - Use 2 spaces for indentation.
     - Avoid trailing whitespaces.
     - Use lowercase for keys unless otherwise required.
   - For Helm templates:
     - Wrap variables in double curly braces (`{{ }}`) and use `.Values` for accessing configuration values.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and files.
   - For Git branches:
     - Use a `type/description` format, such as `feature/add-issuer` or `defect/fix-linter-error`.
     - The only permissible types are:
        * `feature`: New functionality or enhancement that adds value to the system or addresses a specific user need.
        * `defect`: An issue or bug causing unintended behavior, preventing the system from meeting its requirements.
        * `debt`: Technical debt identifies suboptimal code that needs refactoring or improvement. This includes refacoring code that is difficult to maintain, lacks proper documentation, or is not scalable or upgrading dependencies.
        * `risk`: Technical risk associated with gaps in security, privacy or compliance. This includes vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or other issues that could lead to a security incident.
        
   - For commits:
     - Use imperative tone, e.g., `Add feature X` or `Fix issue Y`.

3. **Comments**:
   - Provide clear and concise comments for non-obvious code.
   - For YAML and Helm templates, include comments to explain configuration values or template logic.

4. **Git Commit Messages**:
   - Start with a concise summary of the change (50 characters max).
   - Use the following format:
     ```
     <type>(<scope>): <summary>
     
     <optional long description>
     ```
   - Examples:
     - `defect(issuer): Correct private key reference logic`
     - `feature(chart): Add support for multiple DNS zones`

5. **File Organization**:
   - Group related resources and templates logically.
   - Avoid creating overly large files; split functionality into multiple files if necessary.

6. **Testing**:
   - Include unit tests for new functionality when applicable.
   - Validate Helm charts using `helm lint` and `helm template` to ensure correctness.

## üîí Security Considerations

Maintaining the security of the project is paramount. Follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions do not introduce vulnerabilities:

1. **Sensitive Data**:
   - Never include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets, private keys) in the codebase.
   - Use Kubernetes Secrets or other secure mechanisms to store sensitive data.
   - Ensure that sensitive data in `values.yaml` is parameterized and documented with warnings.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Avoid introducing dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like `trivy`, `snyk`, or `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

3. **Pull Request Reviews**:
   - Ensure all code changes are reviewed by maintainers or peers.
   - Address security-related comments promptly.

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate user inputs in templates and scripts to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
   - For Helm templates, use `quote` and `default` where applicable to avoid unintended behavior:
     ```yaml
     name: {{ .Values.name | quote }}
     ```

5. **Access Control**:
   - Avoid creating overly permissive RBAC roles in Kubernetes.
   - Follow the principle of least privilege for service accounts and roles.

6. **Testing for Security**:
   - Include tests that validate the secure handling of secrets and sensitive configurations.
   - Use tools like `kube-bench` or `kube-hunter` to ensure cluster-level security.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Clearly document any configurations or settings that may have security implications.
   - Warn users about potential risks (e.g., enabling self-signed certificates in production environments).
